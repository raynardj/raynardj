- ‚ö°Ô∏è Hi, I‚Äôm @raynardj, I code fast, automate hard problems/
- üó° deep learning (especially play with tensor part), movie trivials, books
- ‚≠êÔ∏è I‚Äôm seek collaboration on automated DL tools

## Kaggle competions
* Progerssion system: Expert. 2xü•â medals, 1xü•à medals [kaggle profile page](https://www.kaggle.com/raynardj)

## Opensource

### Tools
* Taichi-Engine: Automated UI based multimodal DL tool. [Documentation](https://tai-chi-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), github [here](https://github.com/tcengine/tai-chi/tree/main), or the following video explain the idea.
    * [![tai-chi-engine](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uIeX0VvLKd4/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEcCNACELwBSFXyq4qpAw4IARUAAIhCGAFwAcABBg==&rs=AOn4CLB3U-0L78ImtgY0T7L_6yzL1GJhSA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIeX0VvLKd4)
* glow-cli: a commandline tool that can boost your efficiency [`pip install glow-cli`](https://pypi.org/project/glow-cli/), for now the code is close sourced. eg. you can do cool stunts in your terminal by asking
    * `g llm "explain what's the name pattern under $(ls /dev) and which file might be the usb flash drive?"`
    * `g llm "how do I mount one of the pod with keyword 'abc', the pods are $(kubectl get pods)"`
* Category: `Rust` accelerated category translation toolset: Category [`pip install category`](https://github.com/raynardj/category), based on the `Rust` core part of the library [`pip install rust-category`](https://github.com/raynardj/rust_category) also by Ray
* Language Annotation library [`pip install langhuan`](https://github.com/raynardj/langhuan)
* [python4ml](https://github.com/raynardj/python4ml/tree/main): The library I kept accumulating the tutorial while teaching DL at cokerbunker(a coding community)
* [unpackai](https://github.com/unpackAI/unpackai): a library I lead for teaching at unpackai.
* As a person who's deeply interested in history and actual archaeological text, I put up and assortment of models to help accelerate ancient Chinese research: [yuan](https://github.com/raynardj/yuan), many of the model uploaded to huggingface's model hub.
* [Docs](https://genomicare.github.io/docs/docs/experiments/) in forms of github pages show casing some of the experiments I did in Genomicare

### Models
* [Huggingface profile](https://huggingface.co/raynardj), it's before the chatgpt era, some for medical research paper extraction, some for ancient chinese. Most `space` haven't catch up with maintenance much.

## Here are some videos I made üì∫
